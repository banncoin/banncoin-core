# Contributing to Banncoin

Thanks for your interest!

## Ground rules
- **No secrets or ops material** in this repo. Do not commit keys, logs, tokens, IPs, or admin tooling.
- **No binaries** in source control. Release artifacts live under *GitHub Releases*.
- Public JSON endpoints (`/docs/status.json`, `/docs/manifest.json`, `/docs/recent.json`) are a **public API** — add only documented fields.

## How to contribute
1. Fork and branch from `main`.
2. Keep PRs small and focused.
3. Add tests or sample data when relevant.
4. Run CI locally if possible; fix lint errors.

## Reporting security issues
See **SECURITY.md** and email **contact@banncoin.org**.
